# semi_supervised

In this project, I try to apply PNU and PUNU risks from http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06955 to investigate their superiority over the normal PN risk when applied on CNNs, etc.
There applications over SVMs and similar architectures was already tried out in the above paper and can be checked.
