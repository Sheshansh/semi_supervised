so, this method fails to improve upon the pn classification in the experiments I tried on MNIST.

But PN classification can give high variance on accuracies but with unllabelled data the accuracy doesn't fluctuate very much.

Probably this is what is meant by the variance reduction claim.

For Ex : Even after convergence, the accuracy varies between 91-95.7%
But with unlabelled samples, the accuracy lies between 94-94.6%.

Which is better is not very clear and hence, let's drop this idea to apply on other images.
